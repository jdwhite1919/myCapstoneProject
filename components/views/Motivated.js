    <h1>Getting Motivated</h1>

    <p>Nothing is harder than getting the motivation to start a fitness plan. Because you are not just starting a fitness plan; it is a lifestyle change. We all get motivated in different ways, and we need to find a way that best motivates us. Let us get you started. What is the best part about fitness? You can't buy it, you can't inherit it, and you can't luck in to it. A lot of fitness idols relate success in the field to success in real life, and it is not hard to see why. It is your responsibility to make the change. And the best part, all the results are owed to you and you alone. Let's get motivated!</p>

  <blockquote>"Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!" - Rocky Balboa</blockquote>

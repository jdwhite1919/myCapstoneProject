  <h1>To Gym or Not to Gym</h1>

  <div class="healthy">
  <p>I'm not going to sugarcoat it; fitness areas of any king - yoga studios, cycle studies, Orange Theory, standard weights gyms, etc. - are not the cleanest places in the world. People are sweating, shedding, breathing heavily, touching their face, touching the ground, touching the same equipment, and so on. Covid-19 spreads in areas like this, and returning to fitness areas should not be taken likely. It is important to consider the risk; for some the risk is worth it, and for others is not. It is all up the disgression of the individual and past health history should be taken in effect. If you are unsure where you stand, here are some articles from reliable resources to help you make the decision.</p>

<p>A longstanding myth is exercise is they key to a healthy lifestyle and the main contributor in weight loss. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Most health professionals will agree diet contributes to 80% of your basal metabolic rate. This is just a fancy way of saying fitness and a healthy lifestyle revolve around what you put in your body.</p>
<br />
<p>While most people think hitting the gym is hard, what you do in the kitchen is the hardest. But there is good news. Diet fads do not work. Lifestyle changes work. and these lifestyle changes all revolve around a flexible diet for long-term success. We all struggle with consistency in diet, but that is a key indicator that can bring us all together. See what people have to say below!</p>
